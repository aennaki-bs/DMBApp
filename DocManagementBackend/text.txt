Error Responses

400 Bad Request: Returned when validation fails

Document not found
Current step ID doesn't match
Required statuses not complete
Next step not in same circuit
Circuit already completed

500 Internal Server Error: Returned on server exceptions

Workflow Logic

Validates the document exists and that it's assigned to a circuit
Checks that the specified current step matches the document's actual current step
Verifies the next step exists and belongs to the same circuit
Checks that the user has the appropriate role permissions
Ensures all required statuses are completed for the current step
Updates the document's current step
Sets the document as completed if the next step is a final step
Creates a history record of the transition
Creates document status records for the new step

I want to make same changes in the logic of moving a document from step to step:

for example we have:

ciruitA =>

status1-Sales Doc creation  ->  step1

status2-Create Customer     ->  step2

status3-Create Items        ->  step2

status4-Create Quantities   ->  step3

status5-CReate Prices       ->  step3

status6-CReates Discounts   ->  step3

status7-Post Shipment       ->  step4

status8-Post Invoice        ->  step4

status9-POst Ship & Inv     ->  step4

10-Print Doc 1		action1

11-Print Doc 2       	action2

the document is in the circuitA, he should be moved from status to another, in this example he should begin with step1 and in the step1 we have just the status1, when he complete the status1 the step1 is completed and he should have the possibility to move to the next and he choose one between the two statuses of the step2 either he  choose status2 or status3, when the two statuses of the step2 are complete
