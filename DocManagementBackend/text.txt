1. Schema Analysis & Optimization
Looking at your current implementation, I can see you've built a good foundation for document management with circuits, but there are several opportunities for optimization. Here's a refined schema:
sqlCREATE TABLE Circuit (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    CircuitKey NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Title NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Descriptif NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    IsActive BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    HasOrderedFlow BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    AllowBacktrack BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    CrdCounter INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE Step (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    StepKey NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    CircuitId INT NOT NULL,
    Title NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Descriptif NVARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    OrderIndex INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    ResponsibleRoleId INT,
    NextStepId INT,
    PrevStepId INT,
    IsFinalStep BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (CircuitId) REFERENCES Circuit(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (ResponsibleRoleId) REFERENCES Role(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (NextStepId) REFERENCES Step(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (PrevStepId) REFERENCES Step(Id)
);

CREATE TABLE Status (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    StatusKey NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    StepId INT NOT NULL,
    Title NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    IsRequired BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    IsComplete BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (StepId) REFERENCES Step(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE Action (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    ActionKey NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Title NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(500)
);

CREATE TABLE StepAction (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    StepId INT NOT NULL,
    ActionId INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (StepId) REFERENCES Step(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (ActionId) REFERENCES Action(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE (StepId, ActionId)
);

CREATE TABLE Document (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    DocumentKey NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    Title NVARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Content NVARCHAR(MAX),
    CircuitId INT,
    CurrentStepId INT,
    Status INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- 0=Draft, 1=In Progress, 2=Completed, 3=Rejected
    IsCircuitCompleted BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    CreatedByUserId INT NOT NULL,
    CreatedAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    UpdatedAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    FOREIGN KEY (CircuitId) REFERENCES Circuit(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (CurrentStepId) REFERENCES Step(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (CreatedByUserId) REFERENCES User(Id)
);

CREATE TABLE DocumentHistory (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    DocumentId INT NOT NULL,
    StepId INT NOT NULL,
    ActionId INT NOT NULL,
    StatusId INT,
    ProcessedByUserId INT NOT NULL,
    ProcessedAt DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    Comments NVARCHAR(500),
    IsApproved BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (DocumentId) REFERENCES Document(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (StepId) REFERENCES Step(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (ActionId) REFERENCES Action(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (StatusId) REFERENCES Status(Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProcessedByUserId) REFERENCES User(Id)
);

CREATE TABLE DocumentStatus (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    DocumentId INT NOT NULL,
    StatusId INT NOT NULL,
    IsComplete BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    CompletedByUserId INT,
    CompletedAt DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (DocumentId) REFERENCES Document(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (StatusId) REFERENCES Status(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (CompletedByUserId) REFERENCES User(Id),
    UNIQUE (DocumentId, StatusId)
);
2. Key Improvements Over Current Implementation

Explicit Step Management: Your original schema did not fully articulate the step management I see in the code. Added NextStepId and PrevStepId to make the step flow explicit.
StepAction Junction Table: Added to properly model the many-to-many relationship between steps and actions.
DocumentStatus Tracking: Implemented a table that specifically tracks the status of each document against each required status in the circuit.
Refined Relationships: Ensured that all foreign key relationships are explicitly defined with appropriate cascade behaviors.
Additional Fields: Added Description to actions and expanded tracking fields in history.

3. Document Lifecycle Flow Design
Here's how the document would flow through the system:

Document Creation:

Document is created with status "Draft" (0)
No circuit is assigned initially


Circuit Assignment:

User assigns document to a circuit
System sets CircuitId and identifies the first step based on OrderIndex
CurrentStepId is set to this first step
Status changes to "In Progress" (1)
Entry is logged in DocumentHistory


Step Processing:

System determines all required statuses for the current step
Creates entries in DocumentStatus for each status
Users with appropriate roles can perform actions on the document
Each action updates corresponding statuses via DocumentStatus
All actions are logged in DocumentHistory


Step Transition:

When all required statuses for the current step are complete, document is eligible to move to next step
If HasOrderedFlow is true, progression must follow NextStepId
If AllowBacktrack is true, document can be sent back to PrevStepId
Entry is logged in DocumentHistory for the transition


Circuit Completion:

When document reaches a step where IsFinalStep is true and all required statuses are complete
System sets IsCircuitCompleted to true
Status changes to "Completed" (2)
Entry is logged in DocumentHistory


Rejection:

At any step, if action with negative outcome (rejection) is taken
Status changes to "Rejected" (3)
Entry is logged in DocumentHistory



4. Backend Logic & API Design
Core Services

CircuitManagementService:

Manages circuit definitions (CRUD)

DocumentWorkflowService:

Core service that handles document progression
Implements the business logic for status requirements

5. Implementation Recommendations

Implement backtracking with proper permission checks


Improve Role-Based Permissions:

Enhance step definition to include role requirements
Implement permission checks in action processing
Add delegation capabilities for temporary role assignments


Optimize Database Queries:

Create indexes on frequently queried fields
Consider using stored procedures for complex workflow transitions
Implement caching for circuit and step definitions


Enhance History Tracking:

Log more detailed information about status changes
Add support for comments/notes at each step
Implement visual timeline representation of document history



6. Advanced Features to Consider

Conditional Routing:

Allow dynamic next steps based on document data or action outcomes
Implement decision points in the circuit


Parallel Processing:

Support for parallel steps where multiple approvals can happen simultaneously
Join points where all parallel paths must complete before proceeding


Due Date Management:

Add SLA tracking for each step
Implement escalation paths for overdue items


Template Management:

Create circuit templates for common workflows
Allow for cloning and customization of circuits


Analytics & Reporting:
